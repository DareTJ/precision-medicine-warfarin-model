This project develops a predictive model for pharmacogenomics-guided anticoagulant (Warfarin) dosing, integrating both clinical and genetic factors to support safer and more effective personalized therapy. Warfarin dosing varies widely among patients due to differences in age, weight, concurrent medications, and genetic polymorphisms such as CYP2C9 and VKORC1. Inaccurate dosing can lead to severe complications, including bleeding or thrombosis.

Using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning, this project builds a dosing model that improves dose accuracy compared to fixed-dose or clinical-only approaches. The goal is to demonstrate how precision medicine and data science can work together to inform individualized dosing decisions in real-world clinical workflows.
